ANSWERSHEET

For the first flag i started by using a combination of the strings command and grep with different keywords such as bash, user and more.
That method did not yeald any results so i turned to volatility instead. Using the windows.sessions command i was quickly able to find the 2 active users:
PoC{PoC_W0rk$Hop,BrunoDeChezPoC}

For the network interception i also used volatility and the window.netscan command and ended up with the 7912 PID.
With the windows.pslist plugin I was able to link this to the python.exe process.
PoC{7912,python.exe}

For the full command line that was executed i used volatility once again, this time with the cmdline plugin. i got this command line :
C:\Users\BrunoDeChezPoC\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe BadProgram.py.txt
this results in the flag :
PoC{edc88358ab58eda9f5484e546980f8fc5e76f124}

Using memdump we can easily dump the malicious process and then hash it using sha512, we get this :
