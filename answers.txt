ANSWERSHEET

For the first flag i started by using a combination of the strings command and grep with different keywords such as bash, user and more.
That method did not yeald any results so i turned to volatility instead. Using the windows.sessions command i was quickly able to find the 2 active users:
PoC{PoC_W0rk$Hop,BrunoDeChezPoC}

For the network interception i also used volatility and the window.netscan command and ended up with the 7912 PID.
With the windows.pslist plugin I was able to link this to the python.exe process.
PoC{7912,python.exe}
